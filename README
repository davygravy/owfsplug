OWFSplug is a fork of my other *plug projects at doozan.forum.com.
Webpage: http://forum.doozan.com/read.php?4,11039


Its 3 goals are to provide these capabilities on nearly any Kirkwood box:
1.  to record data from 1-Wire sensors and to log it database files
2.  to record motion detection images from a USB camera, process those images
3.  to serve both of the above to the web


Key Packages:
Linux 3.3.2 (Kirkwood kernel and required modules)
OWFS (1-Wire file system and support packages)
temploggerd  (automatically generates rrd
Motion (motion detection software, creates jpeg images)
ffmpeg (for converting jpeg into timelapse movies)
lighttpd (webserver)
avahi-daemon (service advertisement)
cron (periodic jobs)


Requirements :  all normal required packages for Buildroot
Tested on : Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, should build fine on any system that supports Buildroot





BUILDING IMAGES:
===================

#To get started & set up your directory and source:
mkdir my-build-directory
git clone git@github.com:davygravy/owfsplug.git


#To get your config set up and build all required packages
cd owfsplug/
cp custom/buildroot-config-owfs .config
make


#To create the actual image files/bins that will be flashed to NAND:
cd output/images

cat <<END >rootfs.cfg
[ubifs]
mode=ubi
image=rootfs.ubifs
vol_id=0
vol_type=dynamic
vol_name=rootfs
vol_flags=autoresize
END

ubinize -o rootfs-mtd2.img -m 2048 -p 128KiB -s 512 rootfs.cfg
dd if=uImage of=uImage-mtd1.img bs=512K conv=sync



INSTALLING IMAGES:
===================
Identical to process for Jeff Doozan's V2 Rescue image (or AFPDplug, SMBplug)



SETUP and OPERATION:
===================
(hints:)
consider cronjobs for converting jpegs to mpeg movies
create a few scripts to load the correct USB camera modules
read up on 1-Wire sensors and how they interact with OWFS & temploggerd
attach a USB drive and adjust paths so your data and images are persistent
